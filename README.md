DSA - Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repository is my personal collection for building and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. It serves as:

📚 A reference for myself

🛠 A study resource for others

📈 A progress tracker of my problem-solving journey

All code is in C++, organized by topic for easy navigation.

Each folder contains modular, well-commented .cpp files with input/output examples. File names hint at the problem or approach (e.g. two_sum.cpp).
